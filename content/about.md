# About

Hello! I'm Daniel Firu, an entrepreneur, father, skier, surfer, geek, and all-around technology enthusiast.

## Professional

I'm currently the Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at [Quadric](https://quadric.io), where we're building the future of edge AI computing. Since 2017, I've been leading product development for our general-purpose neural processor IP (GPNPU) technology.

Before Quadric, I co-founded 21 Inc., a Bitcoin/cryptocurrency startup that raised $116 million in venture capital - the largest investment in the cryptocurrency industry at that time. We developed Bitcoin mining chips, deployed 12MW of datacenter capacity, and launched the the "21 Bitcoin Computer" before pivoting to become Earn.com.

## Background

I hold both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Florida. My technical expertise spans AI/ML hardware architecture, semiconductor IP development, and edge computing systems. I'm passionate about making AI more efficient and accessible through innovative processor design.
